Problem Statement

Once upon a time there were two magicians who used fight with each other frequently. In a fight each of them will attack once with their magic powers . The winner of that fight will be decided by the maximum intensity in their powers. If they have same intensity then its a tie.

The intensity of an attack will be calculated as the number of divisors it has. You will be given the power of each attacks of A and B and you have to print the winner of the fight.

Input:

First line of Input consists of the number of attacks(n) both have made.

Next 'n' lines consists of two integers denoting power of A and B respectively.

Ouput

Print the n lines denoting the winner of the each fight in each line. If its a tie print "Tie".

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^5
