Problem statement:
Your task is simple. You are given T test cases and for each test case m and n integers are given.Now you have to print the reversed sum of adding of reversed m and n. Here you should remove leading zeros if any while printing the output.
Constraints: 
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ m, n ≤ 10^7



Example:

Input:
1
24 1

Output:
34

Explanation:
When m is reversed m=42
When n is reversed n=1
Adding m and n gives 43
Now reverse the obtained sum i.e. 34 which is the answer.
